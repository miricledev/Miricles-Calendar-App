I am constantly looking to learn new things and hone my skills in React. 
The next version of this project shall involve linking a backend to the system.
This backend will be created using Python's Flask and will take an account system
so that calendar details can be stored in user accounts and users can receive emails
about upcoming events on their calendar as they begin to approach the due date.

Personal EBI:
- Codebase neater and perhaps split the header and the calendar grid into their own components.

If you are reading this and happen to find any improvements, please let me know! I am always willing to learn something new!
